/*
 * Tile Game Object:
 *		- Tile Game Objects are not placed in the game world. They represent MULTIPLE game objects of IDENTICAL MECHANICS.
 *		- TGO's are IMMUTABLE, but their grid position may have subtypes that represent different immutable versions.
 *		- TGO's do not have a RunTick() methods.
 *			- If a TGO needs to have behaviors (such as cannons firing, or a leaf being destroyed), it must use the Queue.
 *	
 *	The purpose of Tile Game Objects is to eliminate the need for large quantities of similar tiles.
 *		- For example, if there are 1500 Ground Tiles in a level, there is only one class needed to handle their mechanics.
 *	
 *	The Tilemap will make heavy use of Tile Game Objects.
 *		- The Tile Game Object will handle those statuses, mechanics, rendering, or whatever is request on behalf of that tile.
