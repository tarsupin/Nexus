/*
 * This Collision System uses the "Sweep and Prune" style of behavior.
 * The reason I chose this, rather than other methods, is for a few reasons:
 *		1. I'm using a deterministic multiplayer system, and thus testing collisions on ALL objects in the scene.
 *			- Why? Because if there are 10 players in a level, pretty much everything would need collision testing anyway.
 *			- I'm therefore designing for maximum capacity, since I can't just test collisions from the camera's viewpoint.
 *			- If I did that, all deterministic behavior would evaporate. Thus... everything gets evaluated.
 *		2. Many levels are horizontal, which this would be excellent for, as opposed to square-based evaluations.
 *		3. Gut feeling and simplicity? Also because I can swap this out for other methods at any time. So yeah.

//	1. Get every object in the room.
//	2. Order their X-position from left to right.
//	3. Loop through the list, measuring against any objects to the right that can still collide.
//		- If X position of scanned object is < current object's X + Bounds, then current object has no more possible collisions.
//	4. Send any pairs that could possibly collide to Collision Narrow.
