/*
 * Class Game Object:
 *	- Class Game Objects are not placed in the game world. They represent MULTIPLE game objects of IDENTICAL MECHANICS.
 *	- IMMUTABLE values and mechanics. All objects represented by a Class Game Object must have identical and persistent properties.
 *	- CANNOT have Update() methods, as there would be nothing mutable to update.
 *	- Have NO associated position.
 *	- Will render their objects with a dynamically assigned texture and position.
 *	
 *	The purpose of Class Game Objects is to eliminate the need for large quantities of similar tiles.
 *		- For example, if there are 600 Ground Tiles in a level, there is only one class needed to handle their mechanics.
 *	
 *	The Tilemap will make heavy use of Class Game Objects.
 *		- A tile can identify a ClassID that it wants to render through, or use behaviors of.
 *		- The Class Game Object will handle those statuses, mechanics, rendering, or whatever is request on behalf of that tile.
 *		
 *		
 * How Class Game Objects are Stored & Referenced:
 *		Scene.classObjects[classID] = ClassGameObject;
