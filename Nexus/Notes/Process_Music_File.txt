Use Audacity

- Loop the track
	- Zoom in, and look at the leftmost and rightmost sides. Musicians often add little gaps there, which makes looping inaccurate.
	- Subtract the sides.

- Add additional tracks if needed.
	- If alterations are needed, add a track to make the modifications easier.

- Save the project. That way we can return to it later. .aup files (Audacity Project Files)

- Export to .ogg with quality level 5.
	- Level 5 is about 160k bit rate, which is generally considered imperceptible loss.
	- We can't use .mp3, we'd have to purchase a license.
