1. Load "LevelConvert.ts" script on NexusServer

2. Build "LevelConvert.ts" and go to its result in /dist/scripts.

3. In /dist/scripts, run "node LevelConvert.js"
	- Note the ".js" here, not .ts

4. Once it runs, the levels will update into /ryu-assets/levels (from levels-orig).

5. Copy the files from /levels and put them into local data where levels are saved.
	- e.g. C:\Users\Brint\AppData\Local\NexusGames\Nexus\Levels
