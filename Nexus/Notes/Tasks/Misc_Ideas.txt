	- excellent for puzzle games and levels.
	- Activate various objects, enemies, frequencies, etc, from a block like this.
	
	
Redwire / Electrical Cords, Colored. Activates relevant thing(s) connected.
	- Like Incredible Machine

	TNT Suit:
		When you get hit, instead of dying, the screen activates TNT and you have a small bit of invincibility time.

	// Thoughts
	- Boomerang or something that can collect goods?

Attack Powerups:
	
	Ice / Frost:
		- Freeze Enemies; they can't move
	
	???:
		- Replace Slide with a "Knockback" effect. Stand still, but create an invisible knockback force.
			- Creatures within range are forced backward in arc.
			- Also works with creatures above; uses degrees to calculate the force of impact.
	
Familiars:
	
	Raven / Birds:
	
Boots / Vehicles:
	
	can leap on dangerous things below
	
Special:
	
	// These can be used to force certain options, or make choices, etc.

	Timers

		- Maybe set to certain frequencies. Or zones (areas on screen).
	
	Switches
	
Temporary Powerups:
	
	Invisibility (Multiplayer)
	
Temporary Body:
	
	Ghost:
		- Appear like a ghost.

Blocks:
	- Pushable Blocks (like in zelda, not like held blocks)

	- Fire Block; roasts enemies, then turns to rock?
	- Ice Block; slides until it hits something, then stops
	- Bouncy Block; High Jump off of it
	- Moss Block; can climb from it
	
Balls & Physics Objects:
	- Bouncy Ball? What does it do? Just sort of like a TIM game?
	- Gravity based balls (baseball, tennis, etc); TIM game
	
Power Drains:
- Areas that drain whatever power you have.
- Areas that force you to have a certain power? Probably not needed...

Thoughts:
	- Color Toggled Cannonballs. When toggled, they either shoot, change sequence, or get disabled.
	
	New Powers:
		- Shield Dash
		- Intangibility (temporary)
		- Creator: Create blocks (boxes?)
			- Creates temporary blocks? Not permanent? Up to ten? Or just last for a little while.
		- Mines? Stick around for a bit, and enemies can run into them. Have a lifespan
		
Higher Considerations:
	
	Frequency Update (.signal):
		Buttons have "signals", which give off a specific frequency, and which can activate "triggers" react to those frequencies.
		Signals can have an origin point, and their frequencies can be limited by distance.
		If a button (or item) has a distance, that distance can be rendered.
		Signals can also have shapes assigned to them, such as rectangles, circles, etc.
		Signals can have cone shape.
		Signals can be directional.
		
	Enemy Behaviors:
		Climb
		PopOut
		Chase (can provide x or y ranges to limit it, often to make horizontal-only chase, or vertical-only)
		FlightStagger (like the flying boxes; can put ranges on them)
		
	New Campaigns Page
		- A new menu format, with square boxes, each highlighting a different campaign you've played.
		- You can move left/right or up/down across the boxes.
		- It shows off all the campaigns you've done, or a new option in the top left.
			- If you select new campaign, it brings you to a separate version that can load new types.
	
	Chasing Thwomp
	
	Cheat Menu - appears for levels you've beaten, want to play with powers on.
	
	Multiplayer Opposing Build Items; i.e. can move hidden kaizo blocks to disrupt enemy.
	
	Grab Wall has optional climb and slide options.
	
	Damage and Bounce Block damages creature above.
	
	Temporary Powers and Temporary Items
		- Some reason to get to a special area, rather than follow the safe path.
		- Things like temporary invincibility, star power, guns / weapons...
		- Mini powers could give you a small marker? A rune? And you spend it with Y or something?
		
		Potential Items:
			Pokeball. Can throw it at enemies, catch them. They follow behind you. You can then release them.
			Grappling Hook?
			A "throw this" teleporter orb. You chuck the orb, and can teleport there. Could be a temporary item.
			New TNT types that behave differently. Destroy certain blocks?
				- Destroys On Blocks; and optionally could be based on color.
			Blue TNT works like POW blocks.
			Green TNT destroys special blocks, rather than enemies?
			Slow Fall Hat (modify feather hat? angel hat?)
			Book that, when you're over it, reveals text on the screen. Similar to NPCs.
		
		Potions:
			Can use the particle effects.
			Invincible / Destroyer (Star Power)
			Enemy Repel (run a test every update, and push back enemies?)
			Stand on light ledges ( could also do as a boot, or a hat, maybe fedora )
			Float / Reduced Gravity
			Slow Time (Bullet Time) / Slow Motion Power (when you hold the power button, you move slow)
				- Could also be a Wizard power? But more fun as a hat or as a power.
			Potion Shield (as opposed to a power shield)
	
	Level Completion & Mastery:
		- Coins / Quest Gifts are going to be important. Great for those decision paths.
		- Track your level awards (such as if you completed all coins / gems)
		- Campaign Tracking
		
	Collect items by standing near them for a few second, like stealth games where you're "hacking."
	
	Tripwire (background object)  - Or make the once-button easier to trigger? Side-hit, items, enemies, etc. Look like a tripwire?
		- Can be triggered by character, items, enemies, etc.
		- When triggered, it activates something: Button, Enemy, Item, etc.
		- One time color activation (like a button)
	Humanoid
		- Ninja: Can jump within a clearance range, or consistent cycle.
		- Ninja: Can throw Axes.
		- Wizard: Can shoot fireballs, bolts, or targeted bolts.
		- Wizard: Can teleport between locations. Up to three? Or, can randomly choose nearby locations?
	Axe Thrower - Chaotic, random esque within an approximate area.
		- minX, minY, maxX, maxY
		- Also a Jumper Axe Thrower, or a Mobile One (Elemental)
	Giant Ninja Bosses
		- Have TNT Stomp
		- Special Attack Cycle(s); toggles by damage, frequencies, timer, etc?
		- Masked?
		- Can scale up with custom render (same with many)
		
Medium Considerations:
	
	Timer Delay / Timed Block - block triggers or deactivates after countdown: turns on, turns off, ???
		- Maybe a timer delay instead? Like, you trigger something, and the timer delays? 
	
	Special Actions:
		- Sequences on key presses to do special abilities (like right, right, A to activate a sword slash)
		
		Ninja's get a "shimmer jump" where you have a shorter jump, and it doesn't damage creatures.
			- This basically mimics the "spin jump" without having to create new frames for it.
		
	Colored Behaviors:
		- Colored Blocks have special alt behaviors: Friction, Speed Boost, Slow, Grip, No Grip, Climb, Different Durations
		- Colored Generators; output objects while they're on.
		- Colored Conveyors; move while they're on.
		- Colored wires and electronics (especially for incredible machine)
		
	Slow Walk using Gamepad Axes, and on keyboard a separate 'slow' button.
		- Remove the slow behavior from 'action' button.
		
	Boxes or Blocks that enemies cannot interact with, but Character can. Cage / Fence-like?
	
	Level Editor Settings, e.g. set the Timer for the Level, level name, etc.
	
	Sliding can make jumps more effective horizontally.
	
	"Prompts" appear different based on if you have controller active or not. PC key images are used if not.
	
	Enemy Attacks, Generators: Projectile by Time vs. Projectile by Beat vs. Projectile by Quad?
	
	Frequency Box - When hit, this triggers the "Frequency" listed. Those objects are spawned.
		"frequencies": {"Target1": {"mainLayer": {...}}}
	
	Hammer Projectile - like sword, but it damages blocks
	
	Special Boxes
		Coin Box
		Moving Blocks
		Trigger Boxes
			- When triggered, these boxes do something of importance.
	
	Books
	Color Lock Boxes; simple to make, break when use a lock.
	Colored Platforms? Turn on and off. Rather than just solid blocks.
	TNT Explodes when dropped too hard
	Display Gems on Screen
	Key Binds (in Menu)
	
	Create "Secondary" collision hitboxes, add to Alignment Collisions
		- Have secondary bounds be tested for when adding to collision system. Loads as a new type.
	
	Windows; can peer through like with doors.
		- Peaking through window.
		- Drop items through windows and doors.
		- Moving items through door / window?
		
	Potential Creatures
		Ground Enemies
			Spiked Enemy. Slow, can't jump on it. Can still use projectiles on it.
			Stacking? Flat rock thing? You can stand on it, but damaged from other directions. (Can still attack with powers)
			Stand-On with Jumping: Flat Rock thing
			Ground-Following Saw
		Casting Enemies
			- These are important for creating new tech / strategies. Disabling a creature that can fire allows openings.
			Chompers that can use projectiles (multiple types)
			Ninja type with casting. Axes that arch. Or w/Shurikens
			Wizard type with casting. Bolts. Focus fire. Ignores walls.
			Fire Breather? (unsure if wanted)
		Stealth Enemies
			Enemies that "wake up" when something triggers: nearby, move across something, bop something, use item, etc.
			They can trigger events (toggle blocks?), fire projectiles, etc.
	
Lower Considerations:
	- All objects that reset each frame should be contained to a single object; e.g. touching, blocking, peek, status, etc.
	- Downward Nudges
	- Conveyors (Levitators) that can move things up?
	- Storage Chest; can put items in and retrieve them in other chests.
		- Maybe link up to an output generator? Will output them when triggered? Can trigger with sand timer, button press, etc?
	- Ghost Maneuvering: Follow within Range (?)
	- Throwing becomes a power. Some can throw further, higher, etc? Or, B button is a custom throw (horizontal) when tossing up.
	
	- Bad Ninja; jumps up (or variation that stands still), throws shuriken (synced with global timer)
	- Bad Ninja (white); stands still, throws at angle
	- Bad Wizard; casts projectile that passes through objects, like fire ball.
	- Bad Wizard; same as above, but can angle the attack (slower)
	- Bad Wizard; circle of flames around him, maybe moves back and forth
	
	Ceiling Grab (???) - for Black Ninja
	Signs
	
	Spiked Cannonballs (can't jump on them)
	Saws (follows floors, two collision boundaries; one connects to blocks, other wounds)
	
	Tutorial / Level Updates:
		Level Data can provide text directly in the level.
		Level Data can provide shapes directly in the level.
	
	Lower Ground Corners (Grass)
	Permanent Collectables (rather than ones that disappear)
		- Need a new image, something to surround them, etc? Square? Could have a shape surround them? Octagon background?
		- Or they could be part of a generator? If next to a generator, it keeps generating them? Generation Pad in bgLayer?
			- I rather like the idea of a generator pad, but ultimately is the same as a background, so...
	
	Dunce Cap? Something that indicates a misfortunate hat.
	Beret?
	Straw Hat (like cowboy hat, but farmer) - No advantage, like Top hat but without invincible.
	To make slow time work, projectiles need to stop working by time.total and work by time.elapsed??
	Remove Wind?
	Falling Spikes (any different than bullets? sort of...)
	Springs: can hold up to make enemies bounce higher?
	Moving Ground / Raising, Lowering, Rotating; or like chain balls (this basically is mobile platforms...)
	Merchants sell items (voice bubble) for coins
		- How would coins work in the level. Just collect them, no record of each one?
		- Maybe can only put certain number of coins per level?
		- Only applies to your own campaign anyway, maybe just allow it w/o restrictions.
		- Could lose all coins on death? Or lose from last checkpoint.
	Familiar - follows you around like keys. Could do something?
	Boots, Vehicles
	Disposal Item; destroys any item you're carrying (shell, mobile objects, etc); possibly mobile version?
	
	
	Rotating Fire Line
		- This could be created with elementals, technically.
	Upward Springs shouldn't change bounds, and toggle back will trigger with the .update()
		- Remove the toggle() function altogether, except to make it change the frame.
	
Quick Play Menu:
	Send the current menu settings to the server.
	findLevels() in Quick Play needs to be moved to server side. Can't do it on client side.
		- Identifies the levels within your settings.
		- Responds with levels that you can play, in order.
		- Then you can play whatever list emerges.
		- The list will get sorted based on your user settings (if logged in).
		- If not logged in, the list is whatever the default is going to be.
		- The server can save its lists automatically, rather than generating it each time.
			- This way it saves on number of times it builds the list out. Doesn't do a full scan each time.
	Load different levels based on initial settings.
	Randomized play when loading from quick play.


User Account
	/register ; Register Page
	/login ; Login Page
	Once you're registered, use that to save your level instructions.
	
Level Saving / Structures
	Menu that opens up level editing options.
	Possibly have a screenshot saver so that you can add it to your level.
	Saving levels will go into /unsorted.
	Can return to your levels through your home account menu.

	Level Locating Webpage (basically a listing you can scroll through for easy navigation, not an in-game list)
	Level Editing Setting Webpage (set name, difficulty, etc.)
	Settings include Full Size, or Stretch Mode
	
Level Editing:
	Auto-Tile special function with holding left button and pressing right button.
		- It will try to interpret what tile you mean to place, and put it there.
	Build Copy / Paste option into the level editor.
		- Have a quick-access tool that can be used, like holding shift down, or using right-button dragging.
	Better Level Loading / Saving. Improve the entire system.
