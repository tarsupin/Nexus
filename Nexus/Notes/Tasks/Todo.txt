Handle layering with bg, fg, main, and obj. BG is new.
	- Add 'bg' layer to data.
	- Also add 'bg' layer to tileData as 3rd and 4th bytes, move fg to 5th and 6th byte.
	- Convert data to include ledges as 'bg' layer.
	- Add CharStart to RoomFormat
	- Add Scripting to RoomFormat

Console Switch Options
	- Change tiles between two options.
	- Add dictionary for words. Each name points to a class, and each class has sub-type names.
	- Delete all tiles of a given type.


There should be a text indicator in the top center for what item is currently being placed.
	- A description, like "Random Ninja Outfit" or something.
	- Maybe some optional text if it's more involved.

// TileToolColorToggles.cs doesn't have a slot group.
	this.slotGroup = (byte)SlotGroup.Scripting;


Several placeholder sprites don't work.
	- Necro1, Necro2, and BoltNecro won't work. They don't have a value in Power.cs, and don't have their own classes.
		- They are in the texture packer, though. So the textures are ready to be connected.
		- Need to be added BACK to the placeholder in TileToolUpgrades.cs - currently commented out.

Macros:
	- Have a 'macros view' option that shows your current macros.
	- f5 to f8 should be level-specific macros; they can be edited per level.

Console:
	- Debug info option.

Place text on levels.

// need to handle:
// this.Meta = the metadata that the object is associated with - add this to all objects (tiles should be complete now)
// need a function that returns the metadata based on tile data
// needs a function that returns the tile or object based on tile data
