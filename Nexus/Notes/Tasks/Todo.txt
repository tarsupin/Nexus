There should be a text indicator in the top center for what item is currently being placed.
	- A description, like "Random Ninja Outfit" or something.
	- Maybe some optional text if it's more involved.

// TileToolColorToggles.cs doesn't have a slot group.
	this.slotGroup = (byte)SlotGroup.Scripting;


Several placeholder sprites don't work.
	- Necro1, Necro2, and BoltNecro won't work. They don't have a value in Power.cs, and don't have their own classes.
		- They are in the texture packer, though. So the textures are ready to be connected.
		- Need to be added BACK to the placeholder in TileToolUpgrades.cs - currently commented out.

Macros:
	- Have a 'macros view' option that shows your current macros.
	- f5 to f8 should be level-specific macros; they can be edited per level.

Console:
	- Debug info option.

Place text on levels.

// need to handle:
// this.Meta = the metadata that the object is associated with - add this to all objects (tiles should be complete now)
// need a function that returns the metadata based on tile data
// needs a function that returns the tile or object based on tile data
