Dash Power - like celeste; see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sJkEWlyk74 (mario/celeste)		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lTI7Io0m6Y (celeste)
Double Dash Power - also like celeste; have high level of precision to use it; the reset has to be grounded or without jump again
Ninja Suit with Dash Power?

Shoes - AButton (run) turns to Celeste Dash
	- Maybe two types of shoes, one for dash, one for double.
	- Already have the images for this.
	- Also means you can retain your motion powers and stack them.

White Ninja gains Climb ability.
	- This provides the white ninja with a specialty.
	- Also means that climb is now a power; celeste-like.

Ground content that appears from below when you run over it.
Temporary flight lights - you run into them and then you get 2 seconds of flight movement.
Bumpers? Like springs, but multi-directional?

Movers - you stand on them and can control their movement
Different platform dropping speeds; slow delay vs.

Show a speedrun clock (FPS, timer, etc.)

Handle layering with bg, fg, main, and obj. BG is new.
	- Add 'bg' layer to data.
	- Also add 'bg' layer to tileData as 3rd and 4th bytes, move fg to 5th and 6th byte.
	- Convert data to include ledges as 'bg' layer.
	- Add CharStart to RoomFormat
	- Add Scripting to RoomFormat

Console Switch Options
	- Change tiles between two options.
	- Add dictionary for words. Each name points to a class, and each class has sub-type names.
	- Delete all tiles of a given type.

Several placeholder sprites don't work.
	- Necro1, Necro2, and BoltNecro won't work. They don't have a value in Power.cs, and don't have their own classes.
		- They are in the texture packer, though. So the textures are ready to be connected.
		- Need to be added BACK to the placeholder in TileToolUpgrades.cs - currently commented out.

Macros:
	- Have a 'macros view' option that shows your current macros.
	- f5 to f8 should be level-specific macros; they can be edited per level.

Console:
	- Debug info option.

Place text on levels. A text object that you can place? Invisible, but holds text?

// need to handle:
// this.Meta = the metadata that the object is associated with - add this to all objects (tiles should be complete now)
// need a function that returns the metadata based on tile data
// needs a function that returns the tile or object based on tile data


Consider:
Moving TrackDots? Dynamic. Could have interesting behaviors.
