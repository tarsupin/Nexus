Doors need to create a second tile below on creation, or expand border down.
Attachment messages for NPCs, Doors, Characters, etc.
Leaf needs to track 'delay' on a per-entry basis with a key-value gridID pair.
Need LevelScriptEvent class to tracks script events on frames. (Old system: Queue)
Tile Platforms need facing direction to collide correctly.

Cannons, Placers, Conveyor, Chompers (Fire) need RunTick() behavior; perhaps by Generator cycle in RoomScene.
Add Track System (for TrackDots, etc)

Add Param Behaviors

Level Conversion: Flag to 170-174, Placer was 61 (now 63), Track(65), Cluster (dyn 100), Character Flag (100 to 150)
LevelConvert decor, ledges, prompts, etc.
LevelConvert durations, cycles, offsets, anything in ms: divide by 250, multiply by 15 (to switch to frames)

Dash Power - like celeste; see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sJkEWlyk74 (mario/celeste)		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lTI7Io0m6Y (celeste)
Double Dash Power - also like celeste; have high level of precision to use it; the reset has to be grounded or without jump again
Ninja Suit with Dash Power?

Shoes - AButton (run) turns to Celeste Dash
	- Maybe two types of shoes, one for dash, one for double.
	- Already have the images for this.
	- Also means you can retain your motion powers and stack them.

White Ninja gains Climb ability.
	- This provides the white ninja with a specialty.
	- Also means that climb is now a power; celeste-like.

Ground content that appears from below when you run over it.
Temporary flight lights - you run into them and then you get 2 seconds of flight movement.
Bumpers? Like springs, but multi-directional?

Movers - you stand on them and can control their movement
Different platform dropping speeds; slow delay vs. 

/********************************
****** Params

// Params TODO: 
	- ParamsCluster
	- ParamsClusterChar
	- ParamsClusterScreen
	- ParamsContains (combine dictionary with system)
	- ParamsMoveFlight (advanced mechanics)
	- ParamsPlacer (requires dictionary, like Contains)

Checkpoint Params
- Flags need to be able to have suits, powers, shoes, etc.

Contents Params
- Can this be merged with Checkpoint? Checkpoint has a lot of them, though, each separate. Would have to split into multiple categories
	- Shoes, Hats, Suits, Mobility Powers, Attack Powers
	- Even then, not sure if it works.

Placer Param
	- Need another similar set for this, as checkpoint and contents.
	- Can probably create a few methods that offload the similarities.

Is .Meta used? IMetaData in MetaList doesn't need SlotGroup - can be altered with no consequence.

Show a speedrun clock (FPS, timer, etc.)

Handle layering with bg, fg, main, and obj. BG is new.
	- Add 'bg' layer to data.
	- Also add 'bg' layer to tileData as 3rd and 4th bytes, move fg to 5th and 6th byte.
	- Convert data to include ledges as 'bg' layer.
	- Add CharStart to RoomFormat
	- Add Scripting to RoomFormat

Console Switch Options
	- Change tiles between two options.
	- Add dictionary for words. Each name points to a class, and each class has sub-type names.
	- Delete all tiles of a given type.

Several placeholder sprites don't work.
	- Necro1, Necro2, and BoltNecro won't work. They don't have a value in Power.cs, and don't have their own classes.
		- They are in the texture packer, though. So the textures are ready to be connected.
		- Need to be added BACK to the placeholder in TileToolUpgrades.cs - currently commented out.

Macros:
	- Have a 'macros view' option that shows your current macros.
	- f5 to f8 should be level-specific macros; they can be edited per level.

Console:
	- Debug info option.

Place text on levels. A text object that you can place? Invisible, but holds text?

// need to handle:
// this.Meta = the metadata that the object is associated with - add this to all objects (tiles should be complete now)
// need a function that returns the metadata based on tile data
// needs a function that returns the tile or object based on tile data


Consider:
Moving TrackDots? Dynamic. Could have interesting behaviors.
