Level Conversion: Flag to 170-174, Placer was 61 (now 63), Track(65), Cluster (dyn 100), Character Flag (100 to 150)
Doors need to create a second tile below on creation, or expand border down.
Attachment messages for NPCs, Doors, Characters, etc.
Leaf needs to track 'delay' on a per-entry basis with a key-value gridID pair.
Need LevelScriptEvent class to tracks script events on frames. (Old system: Queue)
Tile Platforms need facing direction to collide correctly.
Console for Editor. Allows scripting, etc.
Cannons, Placers, Conveyor, Chompers (Fire) need RunTick() behavior; perhaps by Generator cycle in RoomScene.
Add Track System (for TrackDots, etc)
nodeTesla/_backup/ has worlds/ and levels-by-hash/
Is .Meta used? IMetaData in MetaList doesn't need SlotGroup - can be altered with no consequence.
Enter Editor, get quick instructions to use tab.
Character Start Flag - maybe treat like Checkpoint; can have options of what to start with.
