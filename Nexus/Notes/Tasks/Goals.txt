****** Project Timeline ******
*****************************/

	Interactions with NPCs (UI)
		- Cycle through text.
	
	Text Game Objects
		- Show text in levels, such as forced comments or tips.
	
	NEXT MAJOR: Add Game Mode Functionality; Assist, Challenge. Has "mode designer", which has a counter for which mode you're in.
		- Tiles have a "mode" param that can be set. Makes item appear when that mode is active.
	
	Misc Projects: Trailing Items, Remove Programmer / Free Art
	
	Large Project: Background Objects (Parallax Setup)
	Large Project: (Server Things, Level Sanitizer, Setup Actual Server)

/********************************
****** Core / Prerequisite ******
********************************/

LevelConverter / Mapper:
	Before formatting, save the version number into the JSON.
		- This is important since the update will need to occur at different times. Like when someone actually loads it up.
	Flags Added
		- Allow scripted events, transitions, etc.
		- Can be used for the editor, timed, etc. 

Scripted Events:
	- A separate page / json file is going to be required for adding this. Won't be possible in editor.
	- So if someone wants to do special scripting, that's fine; just use the json editor / api / whatever.
	- Just need the structure in place for now.

Flags:
	- Don't render on the screen.
	- Have an "activation type" parameter: after an x position is passed, area position (rect), position + proximity (circle), timer at, etc.
	- Can have children / daisy chained flags that activate afterward or in addition to. Can also include time delays, etc.
	- Flag can cause a transition, such as: music change, sound effects, camera behavior, boss sequences, etc.
	- Objects can spawn based on the flag? Ticks? Positions? Special bullet objects, like bowser flames.
	- Saved into the room data.
	Options:
		Triggers (all triggers must match to trigger)
			- boundsToTrigger [optional]; sets Bounds that will trigger, can also have offset.
			- proximityToTrigger [optional]; sets proximity and a type of object that can trigger it (or archetype, etc)
			- timerToTrigger [optional]; sets a timed event
			- xPositionToTrigger [optional]; character must pass a certain point
			- frequencyToTrigger [optional]; activates when a frequency elsewhere has activated
		Frequency
			- triggers a frequency with a certain number/letter/word/etc
		Effect
			- sets a global value; which other objects may pay attention to
			- object appears
			- screen effects (shake, etc)
			- sound
			- room change
			- scroll speed change
			- etc.

/******************
****** Level ******
******************/

Text Objects:
	Text displayed cosmetically. (dynamic, to simplify; shouldn't need many times)
		- Color, Size
		- Changing options.
		- Follow options
		- What else?
		
Important Changes, Refactors, Features:
	GameEffect Class (or Classes)
		- Triggers (the thing causing the frequency or effect; could be any actor, just needs to send it through some system).
		- Events (the result of the effect)
		Frequency Effect Class: causes events or things to happen when a trigger is performed. Digital signals.
		Potion Effect Class: Need its own class and behaviors, since it will trigger game-modifying events.
	Chakram
	Phase-In Effect when you load your character.
		- Gives you 500ms to get ready before you begin. That way it's not so instantaneous.
		- Freezes your character, cannot move until transition complete.
		- Visual fading effect, sound effect for teleporting.
	Background Objects:
		Create Layers, possibly a single layer with a "Z" dimension that determines scrolling distance.
	Decor / Cosmetic Objects:
		Make "Decor" class? Or something cosmetic.
	Boxing Glove (projectile weapon)
		- Breaks on contact with something.
		- White: Breaks Boxes, Blocks, etc.
		- Red: ???
		
Trailing Items:
	Still needs to be revised for better use.
		- Only follow to the character's last few spots on the ground. (Takes "touching, down" into account).

Fixes:
	.death is a time.elapsed value rather than a true/false?
	springType may not be needed.
	Can activate "fast" (xbutton) after slow jumping, which makes it weird.

Refactors:
	ungrippable ?
	safelyJumpOnTop ?
	
/**********************
****** UI System ******
**********************/

	Fixes:
		Remove Section or put a use to it.
		Search for // TODO: No longer using messageBox
			- Delete all instances

	Misc:
		Need a font offset based on the type being used.
			- Right now, text is being hardcoded for where it should be positioned. Can't have that.
		Go through and fix instances where font offsets are hardcoded.
			UIDialogHeader
		onMouseOver for headers, can set cursor image?

	Generic-ish Components:
		MenuTiles: Level Icons, etc.
			- With background
		FilterComponent
			- Shows filter options, can switch between them, set them.
			- Gets filter settings from player configs.
		Config (for Icons): buildIconList( button: UIButton, icons: string[] )
			- It uses a poor set, should use Object, if we even want it at all.
			- But doing this is an overhaul of the menus, so, maybe just remove menus.

	Level Menu List:
		Keep everything in its current position.
			- Change the slides themselves.
			- Auto-load in the background based on current filters.
			- Keep auto-loaded content in localstorage for fast retrieval?
		Could instead, at least temporarily, make levels as an actual webpage.
		Automatically place icons with prevelence? Within groups, like "Blocks" etc.

	Future:
		Mouse Drag
			- Highlighted Area getter
		Draggable Object Physics

	Pause Menu UI Behavior
		While pause menu is visible, show secondary text around the edge of the screen:
			- Alternatively, this might belong in the "about" section?
			Name of the Level (e.g. "Some Cool Level")
			Level Tags (e.g. "Difficult", "Minor Trolling")
			Author of the Level (e.g. "Author: Joe Shmoe")

/*******************
****** Editor ******
*******************/

Editor:
	Quick Keys:
		If you don't have a cursor active, QE will change items below. Maybe?
		Control Key(s) being held (such as "Shift" or "Control"); might be hard with typical limitations.
	Undo/Redo functionality:
		- Need to track the last events that happened and have an "undo" option.
			- Applies to all the functions, so we need a long revert setup. Can revert up to 50 edits?
		- "LastTrack" option - tracks which track options? or, just have all of them here as objects.
			{ "type": Undo.Edit, "gridX": 1, "gridY": 5, "was": "something/blah", "changedTo": "blah/something" }
		- "UndoTrackTools" - tracks the last tools that were chosen / swapped out; also key binds?
		- "UndoTrackEdits" - tracks the last tiles that were placed / removed
	Button Updates:
		Buttons can be "highlighted" to show which is active.
	Bind Keys Numbers/Letters for "Delete" and other options.
	ScrollerUI:
		Help Bar Appears that guides based on scrolled UI.
		Each TileTool has its own special behavior with LEFT and RIGHT modifications.
			- ColorToggles will change color across everything (save state in that tool)
			- Items maintain color (when applicable).
			- Platforms keep same facing direction.
			- Generators will face the same direction.
			- Ground will keep to the same type.
			- Other things do other things.
	Settings button pulls up a dialog with options that might be less used?
	Tutorial Box
		- When you're in tile mode, it will show you that right-click will clone tiles.
		- Explains that Q/E will modify the type of item.
		- Changes for other tools as well, gives a description, etc.
		- Can click a "help" button in the bar to open or close the tutorial box.
		- Clicking on it closes the tutorial box.

Future Editor:
	Circle Menu Behaviors:
		- A folder that has functions for how the object should behave when it gets clicked.
		- For example, what sections does it bring up? "Alternate Types", "Flight", "Facing"
		Right-Click object will bring up a circular menu that you can choose each subType?
			- Would be potentially way nicer...
			- The center option is "clone", so that you could have the menu appear on all item types.
	Hover Menu:
		- In place of a circle menu, we could have a hover menu.
		- Basically the same, but you just click on the creature, and select the button? Then pops up a modal.
	// TODO: Do some sort of highlight for button.	(when hovering over the EditorButton)

/***************************
****** BUGS / Missing ******
***************************/

Collision Bugs:
	Throwing button up doesn't collide with ceiling, and will fall up through screen.
	Can clip through objects when riding a platform.
	Goos Fall off Ledges (not ground) when there is a bg object there (it can be statically collided with).
	One-Sided Springs clip error: hold it, run into wall on left, and then turn around. It clips upward.
	One-Sided Springs hit enemy, enemy doesn't bounce properly. Goos are just going back like 2 squares, then flip out.
		- Probably something to do with xEdge. Thought I dealt with this at one point.
			- Might already have an enemy that fixes this, or part of default enemy code.

Miscellaneous Fixes / Updates / Non-Collision Bugs:
	Double-size falling platform right side appears behind "Fill" ledge, but left side visible as normal.
	FIX: Particle Emitter uses the first img and overwrites it as object reference.
		- Need to go into .imgList and change it so that its values are not stored as reference.
	Thwomp is colliding with non-solid toggle blocks.
	FIX: Enemies don't stop flying through air after being hit by a spring, since they have no slowdown effect.
	FIX: Orange Goo just suicided off a wall because there was an off block there.
		(Same?) Fix: Creatures won't dive into offblocks.
	Should die from being toggle-blocked in.
	Fix issues with time speed multiplier (bullet time, etc); might be possible with new time.frame in place.

Confirm Working, Fix/Update if needed:
	Mobile Platforms allow interactions with items when setting you down / moving you.
	Held Items:
		Can do that special grab from below. Requires the .touchChar val?
			- This problem also allows you to jump "through" items from below.
	Altered (dir === 0) to: if(dir < 0) { dir = item.touchChar; }
		- This should make the embed behavior actually work, but we probably don't need item.touchChar for this.
		- Since this is the only place .touchChar exists, just remove it, and use new embed behavior, which is Math.abs(dir);
	
/******************
****** Other ******
******************/

Status Effects:
	Components / Considerations:
		Create status effect components that take effect at given times, when the status effect applies.
		All status effects are in .status
		All status effects get run like .status.{STATUS}.run( this )
		Status effect may also have testing behavior to see if it applies? Or that's part of the collision detection.
	Statuses to Add/Update: Friction, Sticky, Invincible, Slow, Fast, Heavy

Custom Modes:
	Creators will be able to create custom modes that alter their existing level.
	Editor will be able to switch into custom modes of their desired type.
	Example: "Harder" could be a mode, but also "The Floor is Lava" as a special custom mode.
	
Game Mods:
	Standard List of Mods:
		- A list of mods that will affect the gameplay.
		- Allows TONS of repeat content.
		Super Powers
		Invincible
		Checkpoints are replaced with Powerups
		Checkpoints also grant Powerups
		No Checkpoints Allowed
		Athletic (better jump, speed, etc)
		Levitate
		Flight (can hold jump to continue flying)
		Always A Ninja
		Always A Wizard
		No Powerups

		Coins are Powers / Suits / etc.
		Special Item {X} (can include items that don't normally exist)
	RNG Mode
		- Adds random things into the level, replaces random objects.
		- Could be part of the assist/challenge mode structure; set it up so that it randomizes things.
		- Another layer, in addition to the assist/challenge, so that you can do both simultaneously.

Physics:
	Need a new flying physics for Slammer, since the current implementation won't work correctly.

Considerations:
	character
		.onFloor		getter
		.onPlatform		getter
	status
		.isInvincible	getter		// do we want ones like this? Might not make sense...
	Death Alternatives on Timer End: The idea being that instead of death, you could have something else happen.
		- An inconvenience; maybe also depends on the type of challenge level you're playing.
	New Ninja Type: Can't grab walls, but can wall kick.
		- When grab walls was deactivated, this worked. Was interesting. Caught my attention.
		- Might be really good for speed runners.
	
Scripted Events:
	NPCs can react to events, such as to continue talking.
	Allow you to create more emmersive levels.
	Might have to integrate this with the "frequency" channels; don't let it get too complicated.
	
	
Small Projects (2+ per day):
	Menu Buttons have Frame / Border UI option for default sizes, and has a stretch option.
	Level Settings: Forced Border Positions (such as for levels where stuff drops / moves through tracks)
	
Enemy Stats:
	.ignoreShellDamage (rather than .damagedByShells, since that would eliminate most tests)
		- This must be added to enemy stats, otherwise its use in "shell.js" will be dead code.
	
Menu Projects:
	Campaign List Menu
		Table Format, show each campaign available.
	Campaign Menu
		Possible "Start Campaign" Modal would show Mode (only appears if you've beaten before?)
		Convert into Table Format, show each level in order
		Load Levels from the campaign.
		Levels are "Locked" with Lock Shadow until previous level is completed
	Level Modal
		Appears for Pause Screen and Finished Screen
		Options: Continue, Restart, Settings, Exit
		Paused Version has "Skip" option included
		UI for Coins, Timer, Best Time, Name, other details

Moderate Projects ( 1 per day ):
	Level Completion. End Level Flag
		- Fanfare Music
		- Dancing Animation
		- Woohoo Sound
		- Level Details Menu Basics (eventually contains: favorite / star options, tagging, coins, time, etc)
		- Transition to next level based on levels stored in playlist.
	Enemies and Items can use Conveyors, Moving Platforms
	Timed Slammer. Allows you to create slammers that will act in sequences rather than look for Character.

Major Projects (2+ days):
	Hit Boxes (hit them from below, which triggers an event)
		- Fireballs and other powers like it should be able to trigger buttons or some sort of game object.
		- Maybe targets that activate things. Can throw darts at them like Rogue Legacy.
	Timer System
		- Time Item that add +10 seconds to your time. (Time Potion: When you collect it, the timer increases.)
		- Timer that tracks how much time you have in the level.
