Ideal Design Patterns:

	"Pressure without Difficulty"
		Make the player feel like they have to deal with multiple simultaneous challenges to increase pressure without the intensity of defeat.
		The goal is for the player to win, but feel accomplished.
		
	"Two Simultaneous Challenges"
		Have the player doing two separate tasks at once, such as:
			Moving Platforms + Toggle Blocks
			Uphill Climb / Jump + Dodging Cannonballs
			Chase / Being Chased + Throwing Bombs
			Using Projectiles + Moving Platforms
	
	"Speed as a Pressure Mechanism"
		In additon to other pressures, to keep things moving, add an element of speed.
			The speed element shouldn't be overbearing, but keeping the time low with time items would increase the sensation of pressure.

	"Sense of Power"
		The player shouldn't always feel like the underdog. Give them tools and fun abilities so they feel like they can overcome.
		
	"Options and Replayability"
		Give different power choices for how a player wants to approach a challenge.
			- Each choice can also alter how they would finish through a level.
			
Consider a Major Theme:
	Fun				// Uses lots of Suits, Hats, Powers, and opportunities to attack.
	Stunt			// Uses skilled behaviors and athletic moves.
	Dodge			// Uses evasion from projectiles or enemies, possible bullet hell.
	Puzzle			// May require clever thought, complex reasoning.
	Creative		// May use items, toggle blocks, provide several distinct opportunities.

NOTES:
	- Temporary Powers and Temporary Items are going to be important.
		- Some reason to get to a special area, rather than follow the safe path.
		- Things like temporary invincibility, star power, guns / weapons...
		- Mini powers could give you a small marker? A rune? And you spend it with Y or something?
	- Keys are going to be important; can either force certain decisions, or give more options.
	- Completion Coins / Quest Gifts are going to be important. Great for those decision paths.
