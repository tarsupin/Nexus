[[[ Priority Creatures ]]]

All creatures and entities, unless specified otherwise, should be designed to fit within a single grid square (48x48).

Also, everything should be drawn at half scale (24x24).


///////////////////////////////////////
Ground Creature, Walks Back and Forth
	
	This creature doesn't react to the character in any special way. It just mindlessly walks back and forth.
	
	It turns around when hits a wall or approaches a ledge. No special animation needed, we'll just flip the image.
	
	Many ground creatures will end up having this behavior, and likely have special variations that do additional behaviors.
	
	
	Variation #1: Standard Speed
		- This creature is the "base" creature. Just walks back and forth, no reactions or special behaviors.
	
	
	Variation #2: Fast Speed
		- This creature looks essentially the same as the "base" creature, but is skinned differently / has some distinguishing feature about it.
			- Maybe its skin is a different color, or its head is shaped differently, etc. As long as it's clear that it's different.
		
		- This creature moves faster than the base creature, but its animations are the same.
	
	
	Variation #3: Hops Up
		- This creature looks essentially the same as "base" creature, but another variation on the skin.
		
		- When the character is nearby, it reacts by "hopping" upward.
	
	
///////////////////////////////////////
Ground Creature #2, Walks Back and Forth
	
	Variation #1: Standard Speed
		- This creature is the "base" creature. Just walks back and forth, no reactions or special behaviors.
	
	
	Variation #2: Charges at Character
		- When enemy is facing the character, and the character is reasonably close (within 3-4 grid spaces), it will prepare a charge.
		- The enemy very briefly pauses to "charge up" its speed, giving the character some time to react.
		- Then the enemy begins rushing in the direction of the character, quite quickly; difficult to escape its path.
	
	
	Variation #3: Has Shell on Back
		- Is wearing a shell.
		- When he is destroyed (by being jumped on), a shell will appear in his place.
		- Will need to design a shell that comes with this creature.
		
		
///////////////////////////////////////
Ground Creature #3, Walking Bomb, Walks Back and Forth
	
	Stance #1: Walks back and forth normally.
		- This creature is the "base" creature. Just walks back and forth, no reactions or special behaviors.
		- It looks like a walking bomb, but it's not active.
	
	
	Stance #2: Sitting Down.
		- In this stance, the bomb is just sitting down, like it's tired, or just resting.
		- It's explosives are not currently active.
		- It won't move in this form, just sit there.
	
	
	Stance #3: Preparing to Detonate.
		- The bomb is sitting, but now it's explosives are ready to activate.
		- The bomb will flash on and off until it detonates.
	
	
	
	
Themes:
	
	NOTE:
		All themes have their own background. The background must be seamless horizontally, since it can be scrolled with parallax.
		Each theme should also have tiles available that are common within its theme.
			- For example, bricks may also be used elsewhere, but they're important for the castle theme.

	Grassland Theme:
		Basically like a standard, above-world mario level.
		Tiles will also be heavily used in the jungle theme.
	
	Jungle Theme:
		This is going to use all the same tiles as the Grassland theme (or nearly all the same), but with specific decor.
		The background imagery and decor should be altered slightly.
		This is just a way of providing some variation without having to make too much actual change.
	
	Castle Theme:
		Will require bricks and other tiles that provide the appearance of a castle.
	

Character Base (References Available):
	Head - Male
	Head - Female
	Torso - Male (or Gender Neutral)
	Torso - Female (or use "Gender Neutral" Torso)
	Arms / Hand - Resting
	Arms / Hand - Running (Back)
	Arms / Hand - Jumping
	Arms / Hand - Holding
	Arms / Hand - Falling
	Legs / Feet - Standing
	Legs / Feet - Running
	Legs / Feet - Falling
	
	The character's head must work with the existing hair and hat options.
	
	The character's frames are built from the above components:
		Stand (Resting Hands, Standing Feet)
		Walk (Resting Hands, Running Feet)
		Run (Running Hands, Running Feet)
		Jump (Jumping Hands, Running Feet)
		Fall (Falling Hands, Falling Feet)
		Hold+Stand (Holding Hands, Standing Feet)
		Hold+Run (Holding Hands, Running Feet)

Civilian Suit (References Available)
	Create a gender-neutral Character to apply to the Character Base.
	
Ninja Suits (References Available):
	Create a Black "Ninja Suit" to apply to the Character Base.
	There are four alternate colors: White, Blue, Green, and Red.
	Create an "Assassin Head" for the White Ninja as an alternate style for the head.
	
Wizard Suits (References Available):
	Create a Blue "Wizard Suit" to apply to the Character Base.
	There are two alternate colors: Red, and Yellow.
	It would be great if there were unique opportunities for additional layers for designs to further distinguish class/rank/etc.



Shelled Enemies (Artistic License to Design):
	
	Standard Variation:
		An enemy that, when jumped on, you bounce higher than usual.
		The enemy does not die when bounced on, but can be damaged by projectiles and shell attacks.
		
	Shell-Drop Variation:
		The enemy, when bounced on, dies. The shell remains.
		
	Spiked Variation:
		The enemy is spiked. It will damage you if you try to bounce on it.


Slime Monster (Artistic License):
	
	Standard Variation:
		Moves one direction, bumps into a block and reverts its course. Easy to kill.
		Two Colors (each travels at a different speed)
		
	Jumping Variation:
		Stands in one place and jumps. (Note: doesn't have to be a slime monster; creative license allowed)


Walking Monster (Artistic License):
	
	Standard Variation:
		Moves one direction, bumps into a block and reverts its course.
		When it gets jumped on, it becomes disoriented and can be tossed around.
			- Important that disorientation mode has good gripping options.
		May wake up if ignored.


Rotational Flying Enemy (Artistic License):
	
	Standard Variation:
		Always rotates to the direction it's facing (definitely can't have light shading from a particular side).
		Bounces off of walls at a richochet angle.
		It's hitbox need to be square-like due to the every-angle rotation, so it should be *roughly* square to accomodate this.
		Alterate Appearance Option (for diversity)


Cycle-Based Flying Monsters (Artistic License):
	
	Standard Variation:
		Creature that flies back and forth, or in a circle.
		Can jump on top of them. The enemy dies, the character bounces up.
		
	Saw:
		A lethal, instant-kill enemy that cannot be damaged and ignores walls.
		Rotates while it moves.


Stationary Monsters (Artistic License):
	
	Plant Monster, Standard:
		I envisioned this creature like a plant monster that can spew projectiles from it's mouth.
		If it's not spewing projectiles, it's more like a muncher (from mario games).
		The creature just sits there and blocks the way, munching, snapping its jaw.
		Character is damaged if he touches the creature from any direction.
		The creature can be damaged by projectiles.
	
	Plant Monster, Protected Variant:
		This is a variation (metal? stone? bone? artistic license...) that is protected against nearly all projectiles.
		It otherwise looks roughly the same as the standard plant monster.
	
	Plant Monster, Standard + Fires Projectiles:
		This creature shoots fire projectiles. It just needs a slight artistic variation so that it's identifiable.
		
	Plant Monster, Protected + Fires Projectiles:
		Same as above, except it has the projected variant's base. Needs slight variation so it's identifiable.
	
	Harmless Stationary Enemy:
		This is a square-like enemy that just consumes the entire tile (perhaps rounded edges).
		It does no damage to the character, but can be damaged by certain projectiles, making it a blocker.
		The character can also use this as something to jump on.
	
	
Hovering Monsters (Artistic License):
	
	NOTE: These creatures are stationary, but may "hover" - as in, they may not be placed on the ground.
	
	Eyeball Bolt Caster:
		Hovering eyeball. Casts bolts directly at the character.
